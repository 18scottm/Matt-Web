YouTube - I've been doing youtube, since it came out. I cant work on it though because of school and right now it seems like a waste of time.<br /><br />
Gaming - Got my first videogame when I was 6 years old. I've been playing ever since. I don't really enjoy going outdoors like most kids. <br /><br />
Sleeping -  I sleep all the time, who cares about school, if all I do is sleep theres no problem.<br /><br />
Coding - Im not good at coding within ROBOTC, but coding websites is a piece of cake for me. I used to create plugins in javascript but its not even worth my time to continue this. <br /><br />
